# Programming-Challenge---Lexart

In this programming challenge, I created an algorithm that works with a one-dimensional array containing a mix of letters and numbers. The algorithm provides the following 3 types of answers:

1. **Array with Only Letters**: The algorithm filters the original array to obtain a new array containing only the letters.

2. **Array with Only Numbers**: The algorithm filters the original array to obtain a new array containing only the numbers.

3. **Largest Number**: The algorithm finds and returns the largest number from the array of numbers obtained in the previous step.
